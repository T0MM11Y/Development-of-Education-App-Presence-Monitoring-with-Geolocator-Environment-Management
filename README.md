ðŸ“š Development of Education App Presence Monitoring with Geolocator Environment Management Repository

Welcome to this dynamic project! Our repository seamlessly integrates Golang as the API bridge between the administrative interface developed in React.js and the user interface crafted in Flutter. Leveraging the robust capabilities of geolocation technology from Flutter, our application not only tracks student attendance through latitude and longitude coordinates but also incorporates a comprehensive suite of features including roster management, interactive Q&A functionality, and other educational necessities.
